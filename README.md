# Shape-Detection-and-Prediction
Project Description:
This project creates a tool that identifies shapes based on input coordinates and predicts force vectors acting on these points. It works as follows:

Data Processing: Reads data from a CSV file with coordinates and force information.
Model Training: Uses linear regression to learn how to predict force components from the coordinates.
User Input: Takes user-provided coordinates and predicts the force for the last point.
Shape Detection: Determines the geometric shape formed by the input points (e.g., lines, triangles, squares).
Visualization: Plots the points and the predicted force on a graph, highlighting the detected shape.
This system can be used in fields like robotics and engineering to analyze shapes and forces effectively.
